# pitchfork-2025

A Python script based on [Nolan Conwaay's](https://github.com/nolanbconaway) work from [2022](https://github.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-2022) and [2018](https://github.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data).  
  
Most of the data is scraped out of the *json pre-load* and *json linked data* sections inside each html file (url). This avoids a lot of unicode cleaning and proves a robust way to fetch even hidden data from plain html body.  

The thata is inserted into an SQLLite database file.
